# kmm-resources

Generator including Gradle plugin to generate KMM (Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile) resources for iOS and Android. This tool generates Android xml string resources and iOS localizable strings based on a single YAML file that includes all the localized strings to be used in your KMM app. It also generates Kotlin code for your common module to refer statically to those strings (similar to R. in Android).
